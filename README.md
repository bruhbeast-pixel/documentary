# GD Sound Effects
This is a documentary for how to select codes. Every block has code.
### How does codes work?
A code will be attached to a URL to play. Example if the code is "s4451" (_**FIRE IN THE HOLE!**_) then it will play a sound from the URL "https://geometrydashfiles.b-cdn.net/sfx/s4451.ogg".
### How do we find a code?
The best option is [Hyperbolus SFX.](https://hyperbolus.net/tools/sfx) Then select a file and play it. You would see a UI like this:

Then, click the download button (no right clicks). And after opening the attachment, we could see the URL become this (the code doesn't matter.):

Then, you'll copy the code on the URL attachment.

Then you can come back to the extension and import it to your blocks. The sound should play after it is commanded.

### If the sound doesn't play, how do we check it?

We can use this block:

![block_13_08_2024-08_15_31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94b6e57c-d52b-4244-8059-b728086ad8bb)

Then test that block. If the URL is not equal to the URL copied, you should check the code again. If equal and not playing, you should do a **hard refresh** (It may be [CTRL]+[F5])
